Bot functionality:
1. Greeting and information about the capabilities of the bot.
2. Questions-answers about the university admission process (e.g. how to apply, requirements for applicants, deadlines, etc.).
3. Providing information about the university's specialties and departments.
4. Feedback form with representatives of the university.

The bot is developed in Python language using aiogram/telebot libraries to interact with Telegram API. Knowledge of working with API, asynchronous functions and basic scripting in python was utilized in the process. The project helped me improve my Python skills and gain experience in building logic and application structure on my own.
